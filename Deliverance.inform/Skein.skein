(as Tad) You have been hiding from the Demons that hunt you. Everywhere you go, they follow. Angry, wicked demons that want your flesh. You managed to trap one of them, and locked it in the attic.

In the pale light you see a bare kitchen: scuffed wooden floors, a table and some cupboards fixed to the wall. There is a door to the west.

You can see a kitchen table (on which are some sharp knives) here.
