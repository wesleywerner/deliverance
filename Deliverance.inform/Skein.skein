Light pierces your vision as your eyes flutter open. Blurred shapes spin around as you shake the sound of a pounding heart free. You remember a struggle, the abduction, your name... nothing.

Deliverance
A Halloween story by Wesley Werner
Release 1 / Serial number 161103 / Inform 7 build 6M62 (I6/v6.33 lib 6/12N) SD

Loft (on the chair)
You don&apos;t know where you are, some kind of room. You feel too panicked to notice your surroundings. It is difficult to move.

The Girl &gt; </result>
    <commentary xml:space="preserve">



(as Otto) You reach the top of the stairs. Through an open bedroom door you see a doorway leading to a loft: a broken chair and cut bonds inside. You dash into the loft...

Loft
You are in what looks like a loft, crates and boxes stacked against the walls. Wooden floors and white walls surround you. The ceiling rafters are visible. There is a single window. There is a door to the west.

A broken chair and cut rope lies on the floor.
