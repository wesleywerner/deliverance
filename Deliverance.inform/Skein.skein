(as Tad) The room is very dim, all of them are, in hell. You have been hiding from the Demons that hunt you. Everywhere you go, they follow. Angry nasty demons that want your flesh. You managed to trap one of them, now locked in the attic.

Kitchen
In the pale light you see a bare kitchen: scuffed wooden floors, a table and some cupboards fixed to the wall. There is a door to the west.

You can see a kitchen table (on which are some sharp knives) here.

(as Tad) The room is very dim, all of them are, in hell. You have been hiding from the Demons that hunt you. Everywhere you go, they follow. Angry nasty demons that want your flesh. You managed to trap one of them, now locked in the attic.

Kitchen
In the pale light you see a bare kitchen: scuffed wooden floors, a table and some cupboards fixed to the wall. There is a door to the west.

You can see a kitchen table (on which are some sharp knives) here.
