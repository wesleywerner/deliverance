(as Tad) The room is very dim, all of them are, in hell. You have been hiding from the Demons that hunt you. Everywhere you go, they follow. Angry nasty demons that want your flesh. You managed to trap one of them, now locked in the attic.

Kitchen
In the pale light you see a bare kitchen: scuffed wooden floors, a table and some cupboards fixed to the wall. There is a door to the west.

You can see a kitchen table (on which are some sharp knives) here.

The bedroom is somewhat furnished, a mattress on the floor serves as a bed, a bedside table next to it. The window is covered with a sheet.

A large carpet covers the floor. A low and wide table dominates the room, tattered armchairs guarding it. A silver serving dish is on the table. A bay window is to the west, a door to the north.

This place is derelict, remote and dreary. The perfect place to hide an abducted girl. Never have I wanted something so dismal to be so true. I pray she is alive.

You open the door as silently possible.

Living room
An old couch rests against a wall, a painting hangs above it. A writing desk squats in one corner, and a serving trolley in the other. A door to the south leads back to the Parlour, another leads to the east. Stairs go up to the second floor.

Bedroom
The bedroom is somewhat furnished, a mattress on the floor serves as a bed, a bedside table next to it. The window is covered with a sheet. There is something under the table.

You are hanging outside the third storey window, gripping the bed sheet tied inside the room. You can go down.
