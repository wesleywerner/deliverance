(as Otto) You reach the top of the stairs, an open bedroom door in front of you. Stepping inside, you see a doorway leading to a loft: a broken chair and cut bonds inside. You dash into the loft...

Loft
You are in what looks like a loft, crates and boxes stacked against the walls. Wooden floors and white walls surround you. The ceiling rafters are visible. There is a single window. There is a door to the west.

A broken chair and cut rope lies on the floor.

Light pierces your vision as your eyes flutter open. Blurred shapes spin around as you shake the sound of a pounding heart free. You remember a struggle, the abduction, your name... nothing.

Loft (on the chair)
You don&apos;t know where you are, some kind of room. You feel too panicked to notice your surroundings. It is difficult to move.

You ascend the stairs, continuing your search...

----------PAUSE----------
You hold tight to the bed sheet as you climb through the window. You hear a noise coming from the other side of the bedroom door, fear rises up inside. You pull the curtain closed, hoping to hide your escape attempt.

Hanging Outside, third storey
You are hanging outside the third storey window, gripping the bed sheet tied inside the room. You can go down.

The name led to outdated property records, and those led to this address. Time is life, and death. I had to get here quick, even if my partner was an hour away the other direction. I had to.

Second Floor
You are in the second floor hallway. Here are stairs that lead up to the third floor, protected by a security gate. You can go back down to the first floor. You see doors to the north, east and south.

----------PAUSE----------
(as Otto) You run up the stairs and enter an empty room to the north. You scan the room: a lonely mattress, and a doorway to your right leading to a loft. You see a broken chair and cut bonds next to it. You dash into the loft.

Loft
You are in what looks like a loft, crates and boxes stacked against the walls. Wooden floors and white walls surround you. The ceiling exposes rafters. There is a single window. There is a door to the west.

(as Otto) You reach the top of the stairs, an open bedroom door in front of you. Stepping inside, you see a doorway leading to a loft: a broken chair and cut bonds inside. You dash into the loft...

You are in what looks like a loft, crates and boxes stacked against the walls. Wooden floors and white walls surround you. The ceiling rafters are visible. There is a single window. There is a door to the west.

A broken chair and cut rope lies on the floor.
