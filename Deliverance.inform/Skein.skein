Light pierces your vision as your eyes flutter open. Blurred shapes spin around as you shake the sound of a pounding heart free. You remember a struggle, the abduction, your name... nothing.

Deliverance
A Halloween story by Wesley Werner
Release 1 / Serial number 161105 / Inform 7 build 6M62 (I6/v6.33 lib 6/12N) SD

Loft (on the chair)
You don&apos;t know where you are, some kind of room. You feel too panicked to notice your surroundings. It is difficult to move.

    <commentary xml:space="preserve">



(as Otto) You reach the top of the stairs. Through an open bedroom door you see a doorway leading to a loft: a broken chair and cut bonds inside. You dash into the loft...

Loft
You are in what looks like a loft, crates and boxes stacked against the walls. Wooden floors and white walls surround you. The ceiling rafters are visible. There is a single window. There is a door to the west.

A broken chair and cut rope lies on the floor.

Front of the house
You are in front of an old house. The flaking paint and shoddy walkway indicate it&apos;s age and abandonment. The front door is here, the porch wraps around the building, towards the south. You are carrying your badge, gun and torch.

(as Tad) The room is very dim, all of them are, in hell. You have been hiding from the Demons that hunt you. Everywhere you go, they follow. Angry nasty demons that want your flesh. You managed to trap one of them, now locked in the attic.

Kitchen
In the pale light you see a bare kitchen: scuffed wooden floors, a table and some cupboards fixed to the wall. There is a door to the west.

You can see a kitchen table (on which are some sharp knives) here.

Loft
You are in what looks like a loft, crates and boxes stacked against the walls. Wooden floors and white walls surround you. The ceiling rafters are visible. There is a single window. There is a door to the west.
