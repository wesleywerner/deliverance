# Versions

## Beta 2

* Various grammar fixes.
* Allow testing annotations with asterisks.
* Display the Girl character's name, Victoria.
* Add a starting dream sequence, introducing Victoria's life and husband, to build a connection with her.
* Make the tied to a chair message clearer when taking inventory, noting you are tied with a rope. After getting up and falling sideways, you are allowed to take inventory with your one free hand (not that you are carrying anything).
* Add touch feedback for the loft chair.
* Add listening and smelling actions to most areas.
* Made the first escape puzzle easier: Victoria encourages the player to try getting up again, and trying to move the chair hints to get up instead.
* Make it clearer that your restraints are ropes.
* Remove the mysterious "you feel faint" message.
* When the player becomes Otto the first time, reduce the three thoughts on the lead to only one, printed as italics. Less interruptive, and establishes that Otto is not a perp, but looking for Victoria instead.
* Print the direction of the front door.
* Give the outside bay window a direction, and print it's open/closed state when examining it.
* Examining the bones in the serving dish makes it clear they are human bones, who put them there, and that the person responsible is the suspect.

* Add synonymns for the horsemen names.
* Allow reading or examining the impression on the business card.
* Add synonyms for teacups.
* Describe the kitchen door as open/closed upon examination.
* Remove the loft door from play. It was not used for much.
* Remove the second floor bedroom that is empty. It only detracts from exploration.
* Allowing "go out" and "go down" the window when in the top floor bedroom. When the player tries to "put sheet in window" we give a hint to tie it to something instead. Feedback when trying to search/look through the bedroom door.
* Add synonyms to the bathroom mirror for "stain" and "edges".
* Give better feedback when trying to shoot the safe.
* Print the exit direction when in the second floor bedroom.
* Allow looking down when hanging from the sheet outside the window.

* Change the position of the bathroom window so it is inside/outside.
* Change the position of the upper escape window to inside/outside. You can now "go out" it, or "climb through it".

* Let the player look through the bathroom window from both sides, giving different descriptions.
* Prevent Victoria from climbing back out the window after she entered the bathroom through it.
* Looking while hanging outside the lower window tells you that you can "go in", if the window is smashed open.
* Add actions for trying to wash self in the bathroom. They are "wash self" and "wash face" and "bathe" and "wash arms".
* When Victoria exits the bathroom, we end the scene as she runs down the stairs.
* Fix printing the room description before switching the character, which caused the player to see their own self (Otto seeing himself in the living room during the final scenes).
* Replace references to the "killer" with the character's name.
* Simplify Victoria's description.
* Make the loft room description less verbose.

* Add a pulling action for the serving trolley (you can't pull it, but just for complete responses).
* Remove the living room door. It is useless and gets in our way.
