It's hard to establish sympathy for a strange anonymous character (the girl) who just appears in a scenario. Consider a contrasting dream scene where the girl has a happy memory (grounding who she is) - but there are sinister overtones: is there something wrong? When the player does WAKE UP and finds themself captive it would be shocking and the player would have motivation to help the character.

Have you read the Lovely Bones by Alice Sebold? That's a novel about a kidnapped girl. There is also a movie of it.

BTW It's easier to read a walkthrough with one command per line. I guess the linefeeds don't work in Windows Notepad! Also label who the character (the girl/Otto) is for each batch of commands.

TAKE LAMP OIL?
Is there a hint for this? Very cryptic - why would I get the oil from the lamp?

TURN BUSINESS CARD
-Aha I thought those impressions were the key I just couldn't figure out how to read them. HINT needed.

PICK UP THE GIRL
-Unfortunate choice of words. Is there a later scene were everything is ok and they're going on a date? (In the walkthrough we don't know if Tad or Otto is doing this action).

leading to a loft: a broken chair and cut bonds inside. You dash into the
loft...

Wooden floors and white walls surround you. The ceiling rafters are visible.
There is a single window. There is a door to the west.

(as Tad) The room is very dim, all of them are, in hell. You have been hiding
from the Demons that hunt you. Everywhere you go, they follow. Angry nasty
demons that want your flesh. You managed to trap one of them, now locked in the
attic.

Kitchen
In the pale light you see a bare kitchen: scuffed wooden floors, a table and
some cupboards fixed to the wall. There is a door to the west.
