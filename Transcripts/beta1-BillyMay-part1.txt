The Girl > look
Loft (on the chair)
You don't know where you are, some kind of room. You feel too panicked to notice your surroundings. It is difficult to move.

The Girl > use knife on rope
I didn't understand that sentence.

The Girl > cut rope with knife
You curl up enough to reach your legs and sever the bonds around them. You get up into a kneeling position and cut your other arm free. You stand up, wobbling.

Loft
You are in what looks like a loft, crates and boxes stacked against the walls. Wooden floors and white walls surround you. The ceiling rafters are visible. There is a single window. There is a door to the west.

A broken chair and cut rope lies on the floor.

A small cardboard box is nearby.

You can also see a bottle of lamp oil, pots of paints, a tube of hardened glue and some twine here.

You are always self-possessed.

The Girl > w
(first opening the loft door)

On the mattress is a sheet.

The Girl > take sheet
You pick up the sheet.

The room turns into a tunnel, the floor rising up to meet you. Shadows creep in from all sides as your vision fades.


press a key to continue...



(as Otto) The last daylight creeps away, the moon struggles to find gaps through looming clouds. A chill moves over your skin.

Front of the house
You are in front of an old house. The flaking paint and shoddy walkway indicate it's age and abandonment. The front door is here, the porch wraps around the building, towards the south. You are carrying your badge, gun and torch.

Otto > i
You are carrying:
  your badge
  a gun
  a torch

Otto > x torch
A high-powered tactical torch.

The torch is currently switched off.

Earlier today, an anonymous tip was called in at the homicide office. All they gave was a name, in connection with the missing girl.

Otto > x gun
A Glock 9mm, standard issue.

The name led to outdated property records, and those led to this address. I had to get here quick, even if my partner was an hour away in the other direction. I had to.

Otto > x badge
A silver badge attached to your belt, with words embossed on the front, Detective Otto York. Homicide.

This place is derelict, remote and dreary. The perfect place to hide an abducted girl. Never have I wanted something so dismal to be so true. I pray she is alive.

Otto > ! it's called a "flashlight" in the us
(Noted)
Otto > shoot
What do you want to shoot?

Otto > me
Suicide is not the answer.

You pull on the window frame, rust crumbles between the hinges. It swings open.

Otto > enter window
Looking to make sure the room is empty, you slip inside.

Parlour
A large carpet covers the floor. A low and wide table dominates the room, tattered armchairs guarding it. A silver serving dish is on the table. A bay window is to the west, a door to the north.

Otto > take dish
Despite this silly act of curiosity, you have to see what is on the dish. You have to be sure. You lift the lid to reveal bone fragments.

Otto > x fragments
These are his trophies. You are now convinced this is, the right place.

Otto > x carpet
It's once-floral pattern, now faded by time and memory, reminds you of a muddy lily pond.
