Living room
You don't care to notice anything in here, except the harbinger of death, the
Demon. It mocks you, taunts you with ideas of pulling your flesh from your
bones. You have to kill it.

You can see a Demon here.

Tad > banish demon
I didn't understand that sentence.

Tad > pray
I didn't understand that sentence.

Tad > attack
(the cleaver)
On second thought, you don't think that is a good idea.

Tad > *note oops wrong object!
I didn't understand that sentence.

Tad > attack him
Another demon appears behind you, swiping at you with razor claws, tearing the
skin from your back.

You crumple to the floor in a bloody mess, sobbing, bleeding out.

Demon. It mocks you, taunts you with ideas of pulling your flesh from your
bones. You have to kill it.

You can see Otto and The Girl here.

(as Otto) For a moment you stand lifeless, making sense of the scene. The Girl
collapses to the floor. You have to get her out of here.

Otto > *note is Otto seeing the Demon as well as Tad?
I didn't understand that sentence.

Otto > x demon
You can't see any such thing.

Otto > x girl
This girl puts you in mind of a frightened cat. She has large orange eyes that
are like two flames. Her messy, straight, brown hair is worn in a style that
reminds you of a comet's trail. She is short and has an hourglass build. Her
skin is cream-coloured. She has a high forehead and wide feet. Her wardrobe is
strange.

Otto > *note her wardrobe is strange??
I didn't understand that sentence.

Otto > say hello
Whom do you want to say that to?

Otto > girl
There is no reply.

Otto > get her
(The Girl)
You lift her up.

Otto > *note what direction is the exit?
I didn't understand that sentence.

Otto > e
That is not the way out.

Otto > w
That is not the way out.

Otto > s
You carry the girl outside, the cool night air promising peace. You hear sirens
wailing over the hill.
